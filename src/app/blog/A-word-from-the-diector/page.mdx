Hello! My name is Victor, and I am the director of Viams International. We at Viams are a recruitment agency dedicated to placing workers abroad. Our journey began as a tour consultancy, but we soon transitioned into job placements due to a growing demand from our clients seeking greener pastures abroad. Traveling to new places is an exhilarating experience, but it comes with its own set of challenges, particularly the fear of losing luggage and personal items. At Viams, we prioritize proper orientation to ensure our clients are well-prepared and aware of potential pitfalls.

Fast forward to our current focus: work placements. Our mission is to match potential employees with their dream jobs. At Viams, we strive to provide an exceptional experience, setting ourselves apart from other agencies. While we do face challenges and occasional delays, we are committed to maintaining transparency and delivering excellent service. Our reputation thrives on referrals, a testament to our dedication to our clients.


<TopTip>
 One piece of advice I would offer to our prospective clients is to thoroughly prepare for interviews and ensure all documents are in order. Proper preparation is key to a successful job placement. At Viams International, we are here to guide you every step of the way, making your journey to a new job as smooth and rewarding as possible.
